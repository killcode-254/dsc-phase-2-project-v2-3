Project overview:
For this project, we will use simple linear regression and multiple linear regression modeling to analyze house sales in a northwestern county.

3.	To develop a linear regression model that can be used to accurately predict house prices in King County.

About
This project explores real estate data obtained from the King County located in the US, state of Washington and creates a model that accurately estimates the sale price of residential properties 
in the county based on their realty features.


CONCLUSIONS:
1.	The size of the living room is the feature that most impacts the pricing of houses
2.	. The 5 main realty features that affect the pricing of houses are:
a) Size of the living room ie sqft_living 
        b) Number of bathrooms in the house 
c) Number of bedrooms
d) Number of floors
e) The overall grade and condition of the house.


 RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.	An ample living room size should be an investment priority for home developers and home owners looking into renovating their properties. This will attract more potential buyers and has a more significant impact on the house prices.
2.	Properties that effectively incorporate desirable real estate attributes tend to draw a greater number of prospective buyers. Homeowners and real estate developers can capitalize on the qualities found within a property as a selling point and a basis for price negotiations.

3.	The real estate industry is constantly evolving, and it's essential for all parties involved to stay well-informed about market trends.

4.	In real estate transactions, it is crucial to involve real estate professionals. Engaging (collaborating with) professionals for valuable insights, thorough inspections, and comprehensive due diligence.
